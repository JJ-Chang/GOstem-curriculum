      <p>This is my <strong>first paragraph</strong>.</p>
      <p>This is my <strong>second paragraph</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        All the text in this section is <strong>justified</strong>! The
        paragraphs above this one just look like they're aligned to the left
        because each one is only one line long. If I add a lot of text in one
        paragraph tag, all the lines in this paragraph will take up the same
        amount of space. <br /><br />

        Japan is an island by the sea filled with volcanoes and it's ♪♫
        beautiful ♫♪. In the year negative a billion, Japan might not have been
        here. In the year negative forty thousand, it was here, and you could
        walk to it, and some people walked to it. Then it got warmer, some
        icebergs melted, it became an island, and now there's lots of ♫ trees ♫.
        Because it's warmer. So now there's people on the island; they're
        basically sort of hanging out in between the mountains eating nuts off
        trees and using the latest technology. Like stones, and bowls. Ding
        dong, it's the outside world, and they have technology from the future.
        Like really good metal, and ♪ crazy rice farms ♪. Now you can make a lot
        of rice really really quickly. That means if you own the farm, then you
        own a lot of food, which is something everybody needs to survvvvive. So
        that makes you king. <br /><br />

        Notice how all the text in the previous paragraph takes up the same
        width? I did that using the <strong>justify</strong> value!
      </p>
      <p>
        The image of clouds is put on the right using the
        <strong>float</strong> property! I also set
        <strong>margin-left</strong> to be 20px!
      </p>
      <p>
        The clouds are now contained within this section, no matter how large I
        make the image! (Right now I set the <strong>height</strong> to 80vmin).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about">
      <h2>What is GO!stem? (this is also h2 text!)</h2>
      <p>GO!stem is a program to learn about STEM!</p>
      <p>
        This section's text is set to be <strong>centered</strong>! Notice how
        the images get centered too? I also set the <strong>height</strong> of
        my images to be the same, so they line up nicely!
      </p>

        This section is SPECIAL!

      <p>
        Instead of setting its own <strong>class</strong>, I used
        <strong>descendant selectors</strong> to set h2 to have different
        properties in this section!
      </p>
      <p>
        This section has its own background! It's a different image from the
        rest of the body background!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm writing more text here to take up more space so you can see that the
        background is different!
      </p>
      <p>here's another paragraph to take up space</p>
      <p>
        According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee
        should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little
        body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees
        don't care what humans think is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The text in this section is aligned to the <strong>left</strong>! It's
        <strong>NOT justified or centered</strong> like the previous sections.
